#This is the documentation of the Nike test.

## Introduction

The initial file structure was rearranged so that it looks and feels like a proper project.
The main folders are:

    *   data: where the CSV files lie
    *   documentation: where the exercise was described
    *   local_spark: an attempt to create with docker compose a cluster where the jobs could be send to process. 
    This should have mimic a deployment to AWS
    *   notebooks: a docker cluster was created and with the Jupyter Notebooks the data was investigated and solved
    *   src: where the code lies
